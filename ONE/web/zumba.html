                Zumba is a total-body cardio and aerobic workout, which provides a large calorie consumption. A study
                shows that a person burns 300 to 900kcal with an hour-long Zumba exercise.Because Zumba offers different
                options, proponents of the Zumba program claim that it is safe for all ages, meaning that anyone from
                age 0 to 100 can participate in this form of aerobic exercise. Some of the classes are specifically
                aimed at elderly people, to help them build strength, improve motion and posture, and socialize. Besides
                its high calorie burning benefit, Zumba can help lower the risk of heart disease, reduce the blood
                pressure and bad cholesterol, and increase your good cholesterol.
