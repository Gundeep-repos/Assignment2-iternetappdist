        <div><b>What is Zumba?</b><br>
		Zumba is a total-body cardio and aerobic workout, which provides a large calorie consumption. A study shows that a person burns 300 to 900kcal with an hour-long Zumba exercise.Because Zumba offers different options, proponents of the Zumba program claim that it is safe for all ages, meaning that anyone from age 0 to 100 can participate in this form of aerobic exercise. Some of the classes are specifically aimed at elderly people, to help them build strength, improve motion and posture, and socialize. Besides its high calorie burning benefit, Zumba can help lower the risk of heart disease, reduce the blood pressure and bad cholesterol, and increase your good cholesterol.
