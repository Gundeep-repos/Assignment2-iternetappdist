    <h2>Squats</h2>
    <h2>How to do?<br></h2>
    <div style="color: white;">Stand with your feet hip-width apart, knees slightly bent, and your arms relaxed by the
        front of your quads with a dumbbell in each hand. This is the starting position.
        Hinge forward at your hips and bend your knees slightly as you push your butt way back and keep your back flat.
        Slowly lower the weight along your shins. Your torso should be almost parallel to the floor.
        Keeping your core tight, push through your heels to stand up straight and return to the starting position. Keep
        the weight close to your shins as you pull.
        Pause at the top and squeeze your butt. That's 1 rep.<br></div>
